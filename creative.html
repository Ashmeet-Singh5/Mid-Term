            This page is a unique page to my hobbies. I chose this page to be my hobbies page as I tend
            to spend a lot of my free time on more of my hobbies than anything else.To begin with, I will
            start with introducing my hobbies, I have a big obsession with cars and recently I have gotten
            myself into planes.

                    My obsession for cars began at the age of 14 when I first saw a blue Ford Mustang. My first
                    thought at this was how can someone like a car, but that question was for another time as I
                    was already hooked to it, Before I noticed, the owner of the car had already noticed me admiring
                    his beautiful piece of machinery. I was still looking at the stunning light blue color that
                    resembled the skies, before it left my sight, I heard it's engine roar, and before I knew it,
                    my new hobby of cars began and it went long ways. I started learning about all types of cars
                    and got so into it that my friends would call me if they had a question or doubt and sometimes
                    even work on their car. Unfortunatly, I was not able to get a picture of the car at that time as
                    I didn't have enough time, but on the right is a picture that resembles that car I saw.

                    My obsession for planes started a while back but didn't last long at the time as I was still searching
                    for my career goals, I wanted to start a business in a field that was endlessly growing and found that
                    Computers were the leading industry at the moment and was expected to grown endlessly, but my passon for
                    planes didn't end there as I was still fascinated by planes and more specificly private jets, and this
                    become one of my <i>fun</i> goals in life. To this day, I plan of owning and flying my very own private
                    jet. The first picture is what started it all for me, This is a LearJet-31A, It is one of the greatest
                    looking private jets in the aviation industry. When I first saw this on the internet, I caught the intrest
                    I had caught on to with the Mustang, and just like the Mustang, this started all the aviation passion for
                    me. I'm not the greatest with avaiation knowledge still but I am climbing the ladder step by step. The
                    second photo is one of my greatest motivations in flying a plane. The view is from a Learjet 31A in the
                    high skies, living it's life above the clouds. The picture itself is self explantory but in a sense, this
                    is one of my motivations.
