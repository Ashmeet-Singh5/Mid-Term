                    This is the module assignment for Moudle 1, I was expected to replicate a page with links to show my understanding of basic HTML tags
                    and elements. This module was to help me understand how the basic HTML tags are working.

                    This is the module assignment for Module 2, I was expected to replicate another page using HTML tags and elements again, but I was expected
                    to make a structure using only HTML and replicate a page accordingly. I used a table to make the HTML structure as it was what were asked to
                    use to make the structure.

                    This is the module assignment for Module 3, This is where we started getting more into CSS and HTML combination, I was expected to replicate yet
                    another page but using HTML and CSS together to replicate a letter for <i>The Cottage Garden</i>.

                    This is the module assignment for Module 4, This module is where I start figuring out where a website starts getting it's shape. In this assignment,
                    I was yet again expected to replicate a page but change colors and choose my own image to show.
