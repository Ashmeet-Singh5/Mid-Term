                    I'll begin with a simple introduction about myself.
                    My name is Ashmeet Singh, I am an 18 year old college student, currently
                    enrolled in a bachelours program in Bellevue College. I have also previously
                    attended Highline College as a running start student with goals.<br> I typically have 2 different
                    types of goals, <i class="goals">Business Goals</i> and <i class="goals">Fun Goals</i></p></td>

                <td class="section1"><p>
                    I have many business goals, some are very simple while
                    others are insanly hard. To begin with, my first goal is accomplishing college
                    with good grades, this is one of my simple business goals as goals after this become quite
                    difficult. Completeing my college degree is part of my college degrees because I believe it
                    is the start of my entire business plan. The second goal I have is to establish a business.
                    My goal is for establish a software development business that helps build beginner friendly
                    softwares for companiesthat are willing to build their business but are not able to afford them.

                <td class="section1"><h3 class="visitedpages">FUN GOALS</h3></td>
                <td class="section2"><p>
                    I also have many fun goals, like many people do. My fist goal is to be rich,
                    this is important because all my other goals are only possible after I am able to complete this
                    goal. I believe money is a tool, and must be used as a tool to gain freedom. The second goal I have
                    is getting a pilot's license. This is one of my goals because I have a beginner's hobby in planes
                    and would love to be able to fly a plane someday. Lastly, my goal is to be able to travel the world
                    and live my life without worrying about expenses and budgets.
